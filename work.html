            <section>I worked with my friend for a two days during a weekend and I served for three consecutive wedding banquets.<br/>
            It was a tiring experience and since I stood for the whole day carrying heavy trays and plates and walked around serving food to guests, I had blisters on my feet even after the first day of my job.</section><br/>

        <p>It was a fun experience but there were a lot of selling
            points for many products to memorise and there were many customers that were extremely hard
            to deal with and for the entire working duration, it was required to stand and restock products
            from heavy cargo boxes which was a lot of manual work. It was also challenging dealing with money
            because dealing with money is very dangerous. The joy of working there was that I could work in a cool
            air-conditioning environment.
