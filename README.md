My Personal Portfolio
Github: https://github.com/assthehole/my-id-class.git

This portfolio consists of my homepage, interests that I like and what I like to do in my free time, my achievements that I have achieved throughout my student life, how you can contact me through social media or mail, my skillsets, my past student life and my work experience. I included a sticky navigation bar that can help the person viewing my portfolio easily access the contents with just a click of a button. I also included many pictures to make the website more visual.

I mainly focused my portfolio more on my work and student life that can promote myself through what I can do, which is my skillsets, that would be my selling point to people planning to hire me. This also sells my mental abilities which are my core moral values and strengths that could be useful after gaining experience after being put into various situations.

My Design Process:
I went for a more simple and minimal look to look clean but straightforward where I wrote everything that was enough to convince people to hire me for my strengths. I also decided to use pink as my main color because it is a very pretty and calming color that could suit both black and white fonts and it complements my pictures, texts and headers too. I also decided to use a sticky navigation bar because I realise in certain websites, to move to the next page, the viewer has to read the entire page before moving off so I decided to make a shortcut for them to be able to read through in a simpler and more flexible way.

This website is basically for me to sell my strength points out so that people could hire me in roder that I could get a job and work in a firm I desire with the proper skillsets that they are interested in having. From my portfolio, they can be satisfied that who they plan on hiring would not disappoint their expectations prove that I am worth hiring as an employee.

My User Stories:
As a user type, I want to make a navigation, so that I can allow the viewer to access the website with ease. Thus, I created a menu sticky bar to let the viewer visit each and every page easily. What I only hope is that the menu sticky bar does not cover too much of the screen on a small device.

Most of my wireframes are columns and my work experience wireframe has flex containers and containers that include rows and columns.

Existing Features of my portfolio website:
Header: My headers has a border for bigger emphasis on what is going to be in the respective website. The font size is also larger to capture more attention too.
Sticky bar: The sticky bar is useful for ease of navigation to other pages of the website.
Text: The text of information so that people viewing my portfolio website can know the purpose of the website in words.
Images: The images are for the visual aspect of the portfolio website so that it will boost the visual aspect of it.
I also has flex containers and containers to store information in sections and different corners of the page for easier sectioning reading.
Name input: An input box that can allow the viewer to input their names if they want to for me to reach them if they want to leave a feedback or (a) question(s).
Date input: An input box for when the viewer can enter the date for when they read the website portfolio or when they filled in feedback and questions so that I can know how relevant they are.
Email input: The email 
Feedback and Questions Input: The Feedback and Questions input is for viewers to enter any feedback or questions they have for me.

Features Left to Implement:

I want to learn how to add pictures as my background but blurred. Initially, I tried that but it was too hard to adjust to the way I desire so I just used a solid shade of pink that was standard so it would not be too distracting for viewers. It was also hard to see words on it, which made the texts hard to read unless I had anotehr blurred background behind which was too distracting.

I want to learn how to learn how to use flex containers and containers more efficiently. For me, they were the hardest to implememt inside my website portfolio.

I want to learn how to use media queries for different device sizes as it was also another tough feature to implemetn in my style css file as there were so many features to change and experiment.

I want to learn how to store the information that viewers leave in the feedback and questions input box because it is currently just a box to type text in but nowhere to save.
